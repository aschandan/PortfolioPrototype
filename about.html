               <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                  <p class="aboutme">I'm Amandeep Chandan, a student at Wake Technical Community College - studying Advertising & Graphic Design. Expressing and containing lots of creativity, looking for a chance to express myself. Able to excel working alone or with a group, and always eager to experience and learn within the workplace at hand. I continue to work on having and maintaining a diverse set of skills to mesh and blend into whatever tasks are required of me. While in high school, I earned certifications ranging from Adobe products to Microsoft products.

               <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                  <p class="aboutme">I aim to create work that solves problems and excites. I also aim for attention to detail that'll leave my eyes and head hurting from the nitpicking.</p>
                  <p class="aboutme">While I always attempt to seek for perfection within my work, I may not always be able to give it my all. During these times I always hope to learn from these mistakes and provide something of quality for others and myself.</p>
               <h3>Not always thinking about work</h3>
               <p class="aboutme">In my free time, I've been working on a menagerie of things to help improve myself and to have fun in this world. Things such as journaling, reading, learning Norwegian, and writing. Also in my spare time I tinker with this site in hopes of learning how fun web design can be.</p>
